# AISploit(Project WARMIND) Whitepaper

Deep Learning for Cybersecurity Adversary Simulation in Dynamic Environments

### Abstract

AISploit is a framework for employing Deep Learning techniques for use in Red Team scenarios. Specifically, these models may
be trained with prior attack data, in a reinforcement fashion, or ideally inside of a live environment. The ideal AISploit model
will be able to navigate through the attack lifecycle steps, make decisions based on current state and prior knowledge, and
adapt novel approaches to adapt to changes.
